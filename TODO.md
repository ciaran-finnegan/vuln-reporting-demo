## ✅ COMPLETED: JWT Authentication Fix (2025-01-05)

### Critical Authentication Issue Resolved - All APIs Now JWT Compatible
Risk Radar had a critical authentication issue where log management endpoints were using Django session authentication instead of JWT tokens, causing 404 redirects to `/accounts/login/`. This has been **completely resolved**.

#### Changes Completed:
1. **Fixed Authentication Architecture**: ✅ Converted all log management APIs from session-based to JWT authentication
2. **Updated Permission Classes**: ✅ Created `IsAdminUser` permission class for consistent JWT-based admin access
3. **Consistent Response Format**: ✅ All endpoints now use DRF Response instead of mixed JsonResponse/Response
4. **Added Missing Auth Endpoints**: ✅ Added `/api/v1/auth/status` and `/api/v1/auth/profile` endpoints
5. **Updated Documentation**: ✅ Updated all API docs, Postman collection, and guides to reflect fixes
6. **Environment Configuration**: ✅ Added admin JWT token configuration to Postman collection

#### Fixed Endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/logs/` - System logs (now accepts JWT tokens)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/logs/analytics/error-rate/` - Error trending (fixed)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/logs/analytics/by-source/` - Log volume (fixed)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/logs/analytics/top-errors/` - Frequent errors (fixed)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/logs/docker/{container}/` - Container logs (fixed)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/logs/health/` - System health (fixed)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/auth/status` - Authentication check (new)
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/auth/profile` - User profile (new)

#### Authentication Architecture Now Consistent:
- ✅ **All API endpoints** use Django REST Framework with JWT authentication
- ✅ **Admin endpoints** require `is_staff=True` via custom `IsAdminUser` permission
- ✅ **Frontend integration** now works seamlessly with Supabase JWT tokens
- ✅ **No more redirects** to `/accounts/login/` - all endpoints return proper JSON

## 🎯 PLANNED FEATURE: Enhanced SLA Management System (Phase 3)

### Overview
Implement priority-based SLA management system inspired by Vulcan Cyber's approach. This system supports multiple SLA policies with automatic conflict resolution for assets belonging to multiple business groups.

### Phase 3A: Database Schema Enhancement

#### Database Changes Required
- [ ] **Create SLA Policy model** 
  - [ ] `sla_policy_id` (Primary Key)
  - [ ] `name` (Unique name like "PCI Compliance", "Production Environment")
  - [ ] `priority_order` (Integer for conflict resolution - higher wins)
  - [ ] `is_global_default` (Boolean - only one global policy allowed)
  - [ ] Severity-specific days: `critical_days`, `high_days`, `medium_days`, `low_days`, `informational_days`
  - [ ] `created_at`, `updated_at` timestamps
  - [ ] Add unique constraint preventing multiple global default policies

- [ ] **Create Business Group SLA assignment** 
  - [ ] Many-to-many relationship: `business_group_sla_policies`
  - [ ] `business_group_id` → `sla_policy_id` mapping
  - [ ] Validation to prevent circular references

- [ ] **Enhance Findings model**
  - [ ] Add `effective_sla_policy_id` foreign key (calculated field)
  - [ ] Add `sla_due_date` (calculated from first_seen + policy days)
  - [ ] Add `sla_status` enum ('within_sla', 'overdue', 'no_sla')
  - [ ] Add `days_overdue` calculated field

- [ ] **Create SLA change audit table**
  - [ ] Track SLA policy changes with user, timestamp, old/new values
  - [ ] Track asset SLA resolution changes for compliance auditing

#### Migration Strategy
- [ ] **Migration 0008**: Create SLA Policy and related tables
