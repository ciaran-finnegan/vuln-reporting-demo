# Risk Radar Development Roadmap & TODO

## Status: Ready for MVP Development

This document tracks implementation tasks aligned with the MVP Feature Matrix in the Product Requirements Document. See [CHANGES.md](./CHANGES.md) for release notes.

- [x] Scanner-agnostic field mapping tables
- [x] Severity normalisation framework
- [x] JSONB extensibility for vendor-specific data
- [x] Proper foreign key relationships and constraints

## üö¶ Priority Order

### MVP (2 Weeks)
1. **Immediate**: Infrastructure setup and schema deployment
2. **High**: Nessus parser and basic UI
3. **High**: Dashboard and core reporting
4. **Medium**: Testing and documentation

### Post-MVP (Months 2-4)
1. **Month 2**: Additional scanners, advanced deduplication
2. **Month 3**: API development, campaign management
3. **Month 4**: Enterprise features (SSO, multi-tenancy)

---

## üìã Feature Checklist (MVP Only)

### Must Have ‚úÖ
- [ ] Nessus file parsing
- [ ] Asset/vulnerability/finding display
- [ ] Basic risk scoring
- [ ] Status tracking
- [ ] MTTR reporting
- [ ] SLA compliance
- [ ] Business groups
- [ ] CSV export

### Nice to Have (If Time Permits)
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] Advanced filtering
- [ ] Saved searches
- [ ] User preferences
- [ ] Activity logging

### Not in MVP ‚ùå
- Automated workflows
- Ticketing integration
- Exception requests
- Campaign management
- Custom report builder

---

## üìù Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **Hybrid approach**: Django for parsing, Supabase for CRUD
- **Direct DB access**: lovable.dev connects directly to PostgreSQL
- **Minimal API surface**: Only complex operations via Django

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Django 4.2 + PostgreSQL (Supabase)
- **Frontend**: React (lovable.dev)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Deployment**: Heroku/Railway + Supabase Cloud

### Development Principles
- **KISS**: Keep it simple for MVP
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features first
- **User-Centric**: Focus on core workflows
- **Performance**: Optimise for common operations

---

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Technical
- Parse 100K findings in < 15 minutes
- Sub-second page loads
- 99%+ uptime
- Zero data loss

### Business
- Complete MVP in 2 weeks
- Support 100+ concurrent users
- Handle 1M+ findings
- Enable basic vulnerability management workflow
