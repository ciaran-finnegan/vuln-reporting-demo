## Overview

This platform is a vulnerability management system inspired by Vulcan Cyber, designed to help organizations discover, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities across their infrastructure. The system supports multiple asset types, business context management, risk calculation, and comprehensive reporting.

### Key Features
- **Multi-source vulnerability ingestion** (starting with Nessus files)
- **Asset management** across multiple types (hosts, containers, cloud resources, etc.)
- **Business context** through tags and business units
- **Risk-based prioritization** using customizable scoring
- **SLA management** with automated tracking
- **Comprehensive reporting** including MTTR and compliance metrics
